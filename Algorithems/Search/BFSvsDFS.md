### BFS vs DFS

### BFS : Breadth First search
# Cons:
# Shortest path.
# Closer nodes.

# Pros:
# More memory.

### DFS : Deep First search
# Cons:
# Less memory.
# Does path exist?

# Pros:
# Can get slow.

### Example :

# If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
# BFS

# If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare, 
# BFS (DFS will take long time. )

# If the tree is very wide:
# DFS (BFS will need too much memory)

# If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree
# DFS

# determining whether a path exists between two nodes
# DFS

# Finding the shortest path
# BFS
